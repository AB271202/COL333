In this assignment, we had find an allocation of sports zones to locations which minimizes the time spent in walking between them. We have a set $Z$ of $z$ zones numbered $\{1,2\dots,z\}$ and a set $L$ of $l$ locations numbered $\{1,2,\dots,l\}$ such that $z\leq l$. We also have tow matrices $T_{l\times l}$ and $N_{z\times z}$ where $T_{ij}$ represents the time taken to walk from location $i$ to location $j$ and $N_{ij}$ represents the number of daily walks from location $i$ to location $j$.
We formulated it as a search problem and used local search techniques to find an optimal solution.
- Implemented Greedy Hill Climbing with Random Restarts for inputs of small size and Best-first Search for larger inputs.
- A neighbour of a state is generated by swapping the locations of two zones or using a unused location for a zone.
- Since the number of neighbours can be very large ($O(zl)$), searching through all of them to find the best will be infeasible for large test cases. Hecne we transition to the first better cost neighbour found for these cases.
